About the Project:
==================
This was a quick (~4-5 hours all in) exercise in making a barebones, fully static yet pleasantly interactive generator site. Generated conspiracies are passed around via URL querystrings, which makes sharing easy without having to worry about storing anything.

The javascript is half embedded in the page and half in a script tag, which would be embarassing if this were going to go any further.

A meaningful improvement would be to piggyback off a URL shortening API to make sharing easier. 

If you want to use this code, just make sure to replace the facebook and google analytics IDs with your own.
